*** Introduction

*** Infrastructure as Code
  - Define configurations of our networks and infrastructure in a single document or groups of docuemnts.
  - Store these documents in source control.
  - Deploy different versions of the document for each environment (dev, test, prod).
  - Verify the proper configurations and operations in testing environments.
  - Not only can we provision infrastructure but also deploy software on the newly created infrastructure.
  - Agile development cycles.
  - Standardization and reuse.
  - Resource utilization.
*** CloudFormation
  - Process
    1. Code templates in JSON or YAML.
    2. Upload templates from local files or from S3.
    3. Create a stack using API, CLI or console.
    4. Stacks, infrastructure, and resources are created.
  - Components
    1. Templates, documents taht describe teh environment that you want to create and launch in AWS.
    2. Stacks, a stack is deployed from a template adn represents the resources and infrastructure that are connected together and belong to an application.
    3. Once a stck has been successfully launched, we can use change sets to perform updates on the deployed infrastructure.
